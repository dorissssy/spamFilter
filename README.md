# spamFilter

This spam filter uses the Naive Bayes method to categorize emails in the data set, and divided the data set into a training set and a test set. By calculating the probability that each word in the data set is spam or non-spam, it can effectively filter and classify the data. After the introduction of the smoothing method, the prediction accuracy of this model was greatly improved, and finally reached 99.6%. This model also uses various packages from sklearn, including train_test_split, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, f1_score etc. 

此垃圾邮件过滤器运用朴素贝叶斯的方法，把数据集分为训练集与测试集，通过计算数据集中每一个单词的是垃圾或者非垃圾邮件的可能性，有效的过滤与分类数据集中的垃圾与非垃圾邮件。在引进平滑方法后，此模型的预测准确率大大提升，最终达到99.6%。此模型同样运用了sklearn中的一些包，包括train_test_split, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, f1_score等。
